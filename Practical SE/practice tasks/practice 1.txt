A student has a name, a nationality, and an average of his grades.

1. Create a new project, and implement the Student class.
Some attributes of the Student may change later, some not.
Reflect to this behavior by introducing proper setter/getter methods. Don't forget the a constructor(s).

2. Implement a simple test environment (menu or so), which lets the user to test this class (read in the attributes, instantiates the class, write out the attributes).

3. Add a List to your main program, that can hold Student objects.
Read in some students, and tell which student has the best/worst average (remember the programming theorems).
Tell the difference and the average of the worst and best averages.

4. Now that you know the average of the averages...
how many students have an average better than the average of the averages? (remember the programming theorems)
